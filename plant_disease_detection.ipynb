Plant diseases are a major threat to food security and it is important to diagnose these diseases early and accurately. This can lead to a better future for food self-sufficiency, efficient waste management etc. The domain of plant disease diagnosis has experienced a huge progress as technology has evolved -- from visual depiction of symptoms to a molecular level detection. In this notebook, we are looking to detect these diseases from images of the leaves of healthy and diseased plants."
